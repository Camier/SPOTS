Context: Working on SPOTS project (`/home/miko/projects/spots`) - a web app for finding hidden outdoor spots in Occitanie, France. Has FastAPI backend (port 8000, fully working) with 817 spots in SQLite, and Leaflet.js frontend (port 8085) that currently uses static JSON instead of the API. Uses IGN French maps, Playwright scraping, and weather integration. Main issue: frontend needs to be connected to the backend API.
