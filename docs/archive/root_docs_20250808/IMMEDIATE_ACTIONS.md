## ðŸ”¥ Next Priority Actions

### 1. Clean Up Duplicate Scrapers
```bash
# Instagram scrapers (5 files â†’ 1)
- instagram_best_practices.py
- instagram_data_handler.py  
- unified_instagram_scraper.py
- validated_instagram_scraper.py
- (plus archived ones)

# Keep only the most recent/complete one
```

### 2. Fix Broad Exception Handlers
Look for patterns like:
```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # BAD
```

Replace with:
```python
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to process: {e}", exc_info=True)
```

### 3. Consolidate Map Implementations
```
Current: 10+ HTML files
Target: 1 configurable map component
```

### 4. Database Consolidation
```
Current:
- toulouse_spots.db
- occitanie_spots.db  
- instagram_spots_secure.db

Target:
- spots.db (with proper schemas)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Run logging migration analysis
python scripts/migrate_to_logging.py

# Check for duplicate files
find src -name "*.py" -exec basename {} \; | sort | uniq -d

# Find broad exception handlers
grep -r "except Exception" src/ --include="*.py"

# Find hardcoded strings that might be config
grep -r "http://\|https://\|localhost\|127.0.0.1" src/ --include="*.py"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus

1. Choose which Instagram scraper to keep
2. Start replacing print statements in top 3 files
3. Consolidate frontend entry points
4. Document API endpoints

Remember: Small, incremental changes with tests!
