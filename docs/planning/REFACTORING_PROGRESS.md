# 🔄 SPOTS Refactoring Progress

## ⚠️ MAJOR PIVOT: Complete Data Cleanup (2025-08-05)

### User Decision:
- **Remove ALL spots data** (no review needed)
- **Keep scraping capability** for future manual verification
- **Transform to curated quality app** with strict validation

### Cleanup Completed ✅:
1. **Archived 787 quarantined spots** to `backups/quarantine_archive_20250805/`
2. **Cleared database**: All 817 spots removed
3. **Deleted 63 files total**:
   - ❌ Entire `scripts/` directory (enrichment, validation, migration scripts)
   - ❌ `data/quarantine/` directory (787 unverified spots)
   - ❌ Duplicate scrapers (kept only unified scrapers)
   - ❌ Extra databases (kept only `occitanie_spots.db`)
   - ❌ All coverage report HTML files (htmlcov/)

### What Remains:
- ✅ `unified_instagram_scraper.py` and `unified_reddit_scraper.py`
- ✅ Clean database schema (normalized, ready for quality data)
- ✅ API endpoints (all working, 9/9 tests passing)
- ✅ Frontend map application (`regional-map-optimized.html`)
- ✅ Admin interface (`spot-admin.html`)

---

## Phase 0: Prerequisites ✅

### Completed:
1. **Database Backups** ✅
   - All databases backed up to: `backups/20250805_083229/`
   - Includes quarantined data
   - Restoration command documented

2. **Scraper Analysis** ✅
   - Analyzed 4 Instagram scrapers + 1 OSM scraper
   - Recommendation: Keep `unified_instagram_scraper.py`
   - Archived 3 redundant scrapers to `src/backend/scrapers/archived/`

3. **Feature Branch** ✅
   - Created: `refactor/phase-1-foundation`
   - Initial commit with all changes

## Phase 1: Foundation (Completed with Major Changes)

### Completed Database Work:
1. ✅ Documented all API endpoints in `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
2. ✅ Analyzed database schema and created normalization plan
3. ✅ Created migration scripts with rollback support
4. ✅ Built database compatibility layer for smooth transition
5. ✅ Successfully tested migration on backup database
6. ✅ Applied migration to development database
7. ✅ Updated API with verification_status field
8. ✅ Fixed SQL injection vulnerability
9. ✅ All API tests passing (9/9)
10. ✅ **CLEARED ALL DATA** - Starting fresh with quality focus

### Security Fixes:
1. ✅ Fixed SQL injection in `build_where_clause` - now uses parameterized queries
2. ✅ Fixed route ordering conflict (search before {spot_id})

### Next Steps:
1. **Create manual verification UI** for scraped data
2. **Add strict validation** before any DB insert
3. **Simplify API** to basic CRUD operations
4. **Document new quality-first workflow**

## New Architecture Direction:

### From:
- Bulk data aggregator
- Automated enrichment
- Quantity over quality

### To:
- Curated spots database
- Manual verification required
- Quality over quantity
- Each spot must be "100000% sure and documented"

## Metrics:

| Component | Before | After | Target |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Spots | 817 | 0 | Quality only |
| Quarantined Spots | 787 | 0 (archived) | 0 |
| Scripts | 50+ | 0 | Minimal |
| Scrapers | 5 | 2 | 2 |
| Databases | 3 | 1 | 1 |
| HTML Files | 60+ | 3 | 3 |
| Total Files Deleted | - | 63 | - |

## Risk Log:

- ✅ All data backed up before deletion
- ✅ Git tracking all changes
- ✅ Clean slate for quality implementation
