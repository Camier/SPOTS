# üìä SPOTS Data Filtering Report

**Date**: August 3, 2025  
**Database**: `/home/miko/projects/spots/data/occitanie_spots.db`  
**Total Spots**: 817

## üîç Filtering Tool Created

A comprehensive Python filtering tool has been created at `/home/miko/projects/spots/filter_spots_data.py` with the following capabilities:

### Available Filters

1. **Geographic Filters**
   - By department(s): `--department 09 31 65`
   - By elevation range: `--elevation-min 1000 --elevation-max 2000`
   - Mountain spots: `--mountain` (Pyr√©n√©es + high elevation)
   
2. **Type Filters**
   - By spot type: `--type cave waterfall`
   - Water activities: `--water` (waterfalls, springs, lakes)
   
3. **Quality Filters**
   - Verified only: `--verified`
   - With descriptions: built into quality filter
   
4. **Search & Analysis**
   - Keyword search: `--search "lac"`
   - Top spots by department: `--top 5`
   - Database overview: `--overview`
   
5. **Export Options**
   - JSON export: `--export filename.json`
   - Result limit: `--limit 50`

- **High confidence (>0.8)**: 0 spots (needs enrichment)
- **Weather sensitive**: 0 spots (needs classification)

### Elevation Distribution
- **0-500m**: 248 spots (30.4%)
- **500-1000m**: 358 spots (43.8%)
- **1000-1500m**: 198 spots (24.2%)

- **>2000m**: 5 spots (0.6%)

### Geographic Insights
- **Mountain spots** (Pyr√©n√©es + >1000m): 581 spots
- **Water activity spots**: 297 spots
- **Pyr√©n√©es departments**: 609 spots (74.5%)

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

```bash
# Show database overview
python3 filter_spots_data.py --overview

# Find mountain caves above 1500m
python3 filter_spots_data.py --type cave --elevation-min 1500

# Export verified spots from Haute-Garonne
python3 filter_spots_data.py --department 31 --verified --export haute_garonne.json

# Search for lakes
python3 filter_spots_data.py --search "lac"

# Get top 5 spots per department
python3 filter_spots_data.py --top 5

# Find water activities in Tarn
python3 filter_spots_data.py --department 81 --water
```

## üîÑ Next Steps for Data Enhancement

1. **Enrich Confidence Scores**
   - Currently all spots have default scores
   - Implement scoring based on source quality, verification status
   
2. **Add Weather Sensitivity**
   - Classify spots by weather dependency
   - Important for caves (flooding), high altitude (snow)
   
3. **Improve Type Classification**
   - 34 spots still marked as "unknown"
   - Use NLP on descriptions to auto-classify
   
4. **Add More Metadata**
   - Difficulty ratings
   - Best season to visit
   - Required equipment
   
5. **Expand Instagram Data**
   - Only 14 Instagram spots vs 783 from OSM
   - Run more comprehensive Instagram scraping

## üì¶ Exported Data

Successfully exported 83 Haute-Garonne spots to `haute_garonne_verified_spots.json` with full metadata including:
- GPS coordinates
- Elevation data
- Type and source information
- Descriptions and access info
- Timestamps and verification status

The filtering tool provides a powerful way to analyze and export subsets of the SPOTS data for specific use cases, research, or application development.
