# IGN Integration Summary - SPOTS Project

## Overview
Successfully integrated IGN (Institut Géographique National) mapping services to provide rich French geographic data layers for the SPOTS project.

## Configuration Fixed
- Updated `.env` file to use the public IGN key: `essentiels`
- This key provides access to basic IGN services without authentication

## IGN Services Integrated

### Base Layers
1. **IGN Satellite** (ORTHOIMAGERY.ORTHOPHOTOS)
   - High-resolution aerial imagery of France
   - Now set as default in enhanced-map-ign.html

### Overlay Layers (6 thematic layers)
1. **Forêts** (Forest coverage)
   - BD Forêt data showing forest types and density
   - Automatically activated on load

2. **Courbes de niveau** (Elevation contours)
   - RGE ALTI topographic lines
   - Essential for understanding terrain

3. **Pentes** (Slopes)
   - Terrain difficulty visualization
   - Helps identify challenging areas

4. **Zones protégées** (Protected areas)
   - National parks and reserves
   - Important for regulations

5. **Sentiers de randonnée** (Hiking trails)
   - Official hiking paths
   - Automatically activated on load

6. **Hydrographie** (Water features)
   - Rivers, lakes, and streams
   - Important for outdoor activities

## Enhanced Features

### Environmental Analysis
Each spot can be enriched with IGN data:
- Forest coverage percentage
- Terrain difficulty assessment
- Proximity to trails and roads
- Elevation profiles

### Layer Control Panel
User-friendly toggle switches for each IGN layer:
- Visual indicators (icons and colors)
- Opacity optimized for each layer type
- Smooth animations

## API Endpoints Used
- `/api/config` - Provides IGN API key
- `/api/ign/map-layers/ign` - Layer configurations
- `/api/ign/spots/{id}/environment` - Environmental data per spot

## User Benefits
1. **Rich Context** - Multiple data layers provide comprehensive environmental context
2. **French-Specific Data** - IGN provides authoritative French geographic data
3. **Outdoor Planning** - Forest coverage, trails, and terrain help plan activities
4. **Safety** - Protected areas and slope data for safer exploration

## Access Instructions
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:8085/enhanced-map-ign.html
2. IGN satellite imagery loads by default
3. Forest and hiking trail layers activate automatically
4. Use the right panel to toggle additional layers
5. Click on spots to see IGN-enriched environmental data

## Technical Implementation
- WMTS protocol for tile loading
- Proper error handling with OSM fallback
- Chunked loading for performance
- Automatic layer activation showcase

The IGN integration transforms the SPOTS map from a simple location viewer into a comprehensive outdoor exploration tool with authoritative French geographic data.
